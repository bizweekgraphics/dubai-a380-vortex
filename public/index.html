    <div style="margin: 0 20px;">
      <p><span class="break">Airbus Group NV’s A380 double-decker</span> is not only the world’s biggest jetliner, it’s also a flying weather system that can throw off hurricane-strength winds potentially lethal to smaller aircraft following too close behind.</p>
      
      <p>So potentially destructive is the wake turbulence created by an A380 that under current guidelines even a Boeing Co. 747 jumbo must leave a six-nautical-mile gap to the 560-ton colossus on takeoff and landing, affecting the maximum number of flights at the busy hubs where the model was meant to ease overcrowding.</p> 

      <p>Now Dubai, the leading airport for A380 services with around half of all weekly flights, is seeking ways to reduce the minimum separation between planes by deploying laser technology that scans flightpaths for disturbed air. The study comes as local carrier Emirates, the top superjumbo buyer, ramps up its fleet to 140 of the jets, with the possibility of more to come.</p>

      <p>“We’ve got to understand more about the wake vortex,” Dubai Airports Chief Executive Officer Paul Griffiths said in an interview. “If the data is conclusive we can start working on the solution fairly quickly. It’s a critical goal for us.”</p>

      <p>While the wings of all planes, large or small, spin off mini-whirlpools as they carve through the air, aerodynamic studies have shown that the biggest jets have the most impact.</p>

      <p>By that score the A380’s 261-foot wingspan and super-heavy designation put it in a class of its own among passenger planes, and though touted as ideal for busy airports with 525 seats, the capacity benefits would be reduced if an operating slot was lost because of cumulative lags between flights. Airbus declined to comment beyond saying that required gaps are reducing and that the A380 is itself able to fly closer behind all other planes.</p>

      <!--BREAK-->

      <p><span class="break">The separation issue is becoming</span> increasingly acute for Dubai because Emirates already operates 58 A380s as well as 143 Boeing 777s, which are in the next-highest category for wake gaps. The wide-bodies use a hub that’s also home to a host of smaller jets such as 44 Boeing 737s at discounter FlyDubai which are most vulnerable to buffeting by the biggest models.</p>

      <p>At best, flying into a vortex will result in turbulence; at worst, it could cause an aircraft to crash.</p>

      <p>In the most notorious wake-related incident, an Airbus A300 operating American Airlines Flight 587 plunged into the New York suburb of Belle Harbor in 2001 after encountering gusts from a Japan Airlines 747 on leaving John F. Kennedy International airport, killing all 260 people aboard and five on the ground.</p>

      <!--BREAK-->

      <p>A U.S. National Transportation Safety Board investigation found that the A300’s tail had become detached after the first officer applied “excessive” rudder inputs to control the plane as it rode the winds. Calculations at the time suggested the A300 probably flew into the vortex about 100 seconds after it was formed, when the circulation would have been at between 60 and 80 percent of its initial strength, though the aircraft would most likely have survived without the human intervention.</p>

      <p>In 2008, the crew of a Saab 340 turboprop carrying 36 people reported that a passenger had been injured after high winds led them to lose control while landing in Sydney. A study found that the plane probably hit the wake from an A380 headed for a parallel runway and about 3.7 miles or 72 seconds ahead.</p>

      <p>Dubai currently applies International Civil Aviation Organization standards on wake separation, in line with agencies including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and U.K. Civil Aviation Authority. That requires a 747 or 777 to maintain the six-mile lag behind an incoming or outgoing A380, while narrow-body 737s and Airbus A320 must keep to a seven-mile gap.</p>

      <p><span class="break">For seven U.S. airports equipped</span> with wake-detection gear, the FAA permits a 777 or 747 to fly just five miles behind an A380, and in Europe, navigation provider Eurocontrol and the European Aviation Safety Agency gave the go ahead in October for the gap to be cut to four miles, or five for A320s and 737s.</p>

      <p>That will benefit airports including London Heathrow, which competes with Dubai for transfer traffic and where stacking planes are already called in to land in “the most efficient order,”  CEO John Holland-Kaye said in a phone interview.</p>

      <p>Following an accord last month, Dubai Air Navigation Services has the option of adopting the new European norms or factoring in vortex data from 160,000 local flights captured over the past 18 months to develop its own model.</p>

      <p>A review of the EASA plan will take account of the Gulf’s “significantly different environmental conditions” and a “vastly different traffic mix in Dubai of mostly super-heavy and heavy aircraft,” said Ismaeil Al Blooshi, safety director at the United Arab Emirates General Civil Aviation Authority.</p>

      <p>Airports must also assess the risk of wake-separation amendments in terms of changes to procedures and training requirements for air traffic controllers, he said in an e-mail.</p>


      <!--BREAK-->

      <p><span class="break">As part of the project</span> at the Dubai International hub, Bayanat Airports Engineering &amp; Supplies LLC has deployed three Lockheed Martin Corp. WindTracer units that use “lidar” light detection and ranging gear to examine the behavior of vortices.</p>

      <p>Apparatus at the end of the runway sends out pulses of infrared laser light that reflects off particles in the air, the movement of which alters the frequency of the return signal to reveal wind speed and direction.</p>

      <p>Readings are being compared with others from around the world to indicate how far gaps between planes can be reduced. The data examined so far has provided “an initial picture which is fairly encouraging,” but more needs to be gathered before determining the technical path to follow, Griffiths said.</p>

      <p>Emirates said in an e-mailed response to questions that it would “welcome any capacity or operational enhancements.</p>

      <p>Dubai’s leeway for cutting wake delays will depend on the vagaries of the desert environment, said David Learmount, air safety editor at Flight Global, with the whirlwinds best dispersed by crosswinds blowing at 90 degrees to the runway.</p>

      <p>Its main airport, the busiest in the world by international passengers last year, is already operating close to the limits of its terminals and runways. While a new concourse will raise annual capacity to 90 million people later in 2015, plans at Emirates to carry 70 million a year by 2020 mean that even the expanded facility will soon be stretched.</p>

      <p>WindTracer technology has already aided wake-mitigation efforts in the U.S. and Europe, increasing aircraft throughput at some airports by 30 percent, according to Lockheed Martin.</p>

      <p>Eking out more flights may prove tougher in Dubai, where Emirates, which has no narrow-body planes, already clusters its A380 and Boeing 777 services into three daily waves and the timetable actively avoids smaller jets following larger ones.</p>

      <p>“We’re doing all the sensible and clever things you ought to do to get these aircraft away in the right sequence,” Chris Garton, executive vice president of airport operations at Dubai Airports, said in an interview. “We put the little one in front and the heavy one behind it, it’s a no-brainer.” <img class="closer" src="img/favicon-32x32.png"></p>
